## Getting Started

This tech preview is limited to a single server and defaults to the global account. JetStream is NATS 2.0 aware and is scoped to accounts from a resource limit perspective. This is not the same as an individual server's resources, but may feel that way starting out. Don't worry, clustering is coming next but we wanted to get input early from the community.
