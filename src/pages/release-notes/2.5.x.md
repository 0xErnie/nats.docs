# 2.5.x release notes

## v2.5.0

This feature release brings the following changes.

### Notes

* See [important note](./#notice-for-jetstream-users) if upgrading from a version prior to NATS Server v2.4.0.

### MQTT/Monitoring

* `MQTTClient` in the `/connz` connections report and system events CONNECT and DISCONNECT. Ability to select on `mqtt_client`.

### MQTT Improvement

* Sessions are now all stored inside a single stream, as opposed to individual streams, reducing resources usage.

### MQTT Update

* Due to the aforementioned improvement described above, when an MQTT client connects for the first time after an upgrade to this server version, the server will migrate all individual `$MQTT_sess_<xxxx>` streams to a new `$MQTT_sess` stream for the user's account.
