# 2.8.x release notes

## v2.8.0

This feature release brings the following changes. See patches below.

### LeafNode

- Support for a `min_version` in the `leafnodes{}` that would reject servers with a lower version. Note that this would work only for servers that are v2.8.0 and above.

### Monitoring

- Server version in monitoring landing page.
- Logging to `/healthz` endpoint when failure occurs.
- MQTT and Websocket blocks in the `/varz` endpoint.

### JetStream

- Consumer check added to `healthz` endpoint.
- Max stream bytes checks.
- Ability to limit a consumer's `MaxAckPending` value.
- Allow streams and consumers to migrate between clusters. _This feature is considered "beta"_.
- New `unique_tag` option in `jetstream{}` configuration block to prevent placing a stream in the same availability zone twice.
- Stream `Alternates` field in `StreamInfo` response. They provide a priority list of mirrors and the source in relation to where the request originated.
- Deterministic subject tokens to partition mapping.
