# 2.7.x release notes

## v2.7.0

This feature release brings the following changes. See patches below.

### Notes

See [important note](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/pull/2693#issuecomment-996212582) if using LeafNode regarding domains.

### Configuration

Ability to configure account limits (`max_connections`, `max_subscriptions`, `max_payload`, `max_leafnodes`) in server configuration file.

### JetStream

- Overflow placement for streams. A stream can now be placed in the closest cluster from the origin request if it can be placed there.
- Support for ephemeral Pull consumers (client libraries will need to be updated to allow those).
- New consumer configuration options
  - For Pull Consumers:
    `MaxRequestBatch` to limit the batch size any client can request
    `MaxRequestExpires` to limit the expiration any client can request
  - For ephemeral consumers:
    `InactiveThreshold` duration that instructs the server to cleanup ephemeral consumers that are inactive for that long.
- Ability to configure `max_file_store` and `max_memory_store` in the `jetstream{}` block as strings with the following suffixes `K`, `M`, `G` and `T`, for instance: `max_file_store: "256M"`.
- Support for the JWT field `MaxBytesRequired`, which defines a per-account maximum bytes for assets.

### MQTT

Support for websocket protocol. MQTT clients must connect to the opened websocket port and add `/mqtt` to the URL path.

### TLS

Ability to rate-limit the clients connections by adding the `connection_rate_limit: <number of connections per seconds>` in the `tls{}` top-level block.
