# Subjects

## Allowed characters

For compatibility across clients, we recommend using ASCII characters (this may change in future).

**Recommended characters:** `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z` and `0` to `9` (names are case sensitive, and cannot contain whitespace).
**Special characters:** The period `.` (which is used to separate the tokens in the subject) and `*` and also `>` (the `*` and `>` are used as wildcards).
**Reserved subject names:** By convention subject names starting with a `$` are reserved for system use (e.g. subject names starting with `$SYS` or `$JS` or `$KV`, etc...)
