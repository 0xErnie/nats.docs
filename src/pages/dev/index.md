# Overview

This section of the docs focuses on developing client applications using the NATS APIs.

NATS provides a spectrum of capabilities, focused on connectivity and communication between components in a system. A more general framing is that NATS optimizes for the "lines between the boxes".

The core NATS API is [messaging](dev/messaging), providing stateless, low-latency, and high throughput exchange of messages between one or more publishers and subscribers.

[Streaming](dev/streaming) brings persistence and replayability to messaging as well as removes the need for publishers and subscribers to be connected at the same time.
